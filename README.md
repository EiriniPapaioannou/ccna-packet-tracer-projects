# CCNA Packet Tracer Labs

A collection of practical networking labs completed using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of CCNA certification training. Each project demonstrates key networking concepts like VLANs, routing, DHCP, and subnetting.

## Labs Included

### Static Routing
- Configured inter-VLAN routing and static routes to remote networks
- Set up backup routes and verified end-to-end connectivity
- Practiced route summarization and interface configuration

### Inter-VLAN Routing
- Created multiple VLANs and assigned ports to correct access groups
- Configured trunk ports, native VLANs, and subinterfaces
- Implemented and verified routing across VLANs

### DHCP in VLANs
- Set up VLAN-specific DHCP pools with address exclusions
- Assigned DNS and default gateways via DHCP
- Configured router as DHCP server and client

### Dynamic Routing with OSPF
- Used OSPF with wildcard masks to route multiple networks
- Practiced summarizing and redistributing routes
- Verified dynamic path convergence
